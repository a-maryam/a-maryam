## Hi, I'm Aleena!
I'm a software engineer focused on backend engineering. 

I'm currently working on:
- Redis-inspired in-memory key-value store in C

Interested in:
- systems programming
- backend infrastructure
- programming language theory: at a very basic level. I just think that lambda calculus / church encoding is neat!
