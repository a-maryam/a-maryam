#### Hi, I'm Aleena!
I'm a software engineer focused on backend engineering. 
I recently completed a redis-inspired in-memory key-value store in C. 
I'm interested in systems programming, backend infrastructure, and programming languages theory.
I'm currently working on a kanban web app to brush up on JS/TS.
